## Overview

This project was made as part of a language study in my computer science class, "Survey of Computer Languages".

The language my group chose was a specialized library in Python called Pytorch.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a standard workflow for a computer vision classification task. It uses the "Cats vs. Dogs" dataset from Kaggle and a pre-trained ResNet18 model for transfer learning.


### Highlights

- ResNet18 model
- Detects features of animals
- Using Pytorch library


### How to run

Detailed instructions located in README.md on Github

Requirements:

- torch & torchvision
- kagglehub
- numpy
- Pillow

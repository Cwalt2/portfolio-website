## Overview

Start with a strong opening paragraph that explains what the project is, why it matters, and what problem it solves. Include the context (competition, course project, personal initiative, etc.) and your role if it was a team effort.

**The Cyberforce Competition is a yearly competition when the top cybersecurity students around the US compete to defend CRITICAL energy infrastructure. I attended Cyberforce 2025 and this post will describe my experience and what I learned!**

**Key Achievement:** Auditing and overhauling a energy company website for employees and clients.

### The Challenge

- Audit and document steps to defend a compromised enterprise ecosystem
- Present critical issues to a C Suite of executives and owners
- Prepare infrastructure before the attack phase of the competition
- Defend infrastructure from red team industry professionals

### My Role & Responsibilities

- Audit the company website
- Fix any errors or exploits
- Restore the website to a fully functional state
- Ensure maximum uptime
- Secure the web server

## Technical Architecture

### System Design

Describe your architecture decisions and the reasoning behind them. What alternatives did you consider?

```
[Include an architecture diagram here - can be ASCII art, Mermaid diagram, or image link]
┌─────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│   Input     │────▶│  Processing  │────▶│   Output    │
│   Layer     │      │    Engine    │      │   Layer     │
└─────────────┘      └──────────────┘      └─────────────┘
```
